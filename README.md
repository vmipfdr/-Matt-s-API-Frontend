## My attempt at a MERN App using my own API

## Prerequisites

- React
- Node and Express

## Requirements

While working through this project, I didn't understand the fundamental concept of passing state for the entirety of the project.  However, after sticking at it for more than 20 hours over the Thursday into 0300 on Monday (due at 0900) I completed the functionality of the project.  Afterwards, I refactored a bunch of the CSS to make the site more attractive.  [Here](https://weaponsalesworldwide.netlify.com/) you see a full MERN personal project that pulls from the database and API that I built the week prior located at this [Repo](https://github.com/vmipfdr/20-Years-of-Arms-Sales).  I built out a full CRUD platform (hiding create from the user).
