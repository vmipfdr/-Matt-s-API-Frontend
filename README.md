## My attempt at a MERN App using my own API

## Prerequisites

- React (wouldn't it be nice if I actually knew what I'm doing with React...)
- Node and Express

## Requirements

Considering I don't know React, I referenced other labs and homeworks (that had solution branches) to fumble through this. I was supposed to have Create and Read of CRUD, but still can't even achieve full Read. I can render a single object, but that's it.

### Technical Requirements

Your project should meet the following requirements:

- Runs without errors
- Include ways to perform the C&R of CRUD on the resource(s) of your API
- Be deployed to GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Surge
- Includes a README written in well formatted Markdown (_hint: look up a README
  template_)
- Shows a good commit history with frequent commits. We're looking for lots of
  small commits.
